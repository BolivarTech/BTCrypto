## How can I help?

BolivarTech follows a standard fork and pull model for contributions via Git pull requests.

The process is simple:

 1. Find something you want to work on
 2. Let us know you are working on it via email
 3. Implement your contribution
 4. Write tests
 5. Update the documentation
 6. Submit pull request

You will be automatically included in the [AUTHORS.md](AUTHORS.md) file as contributor in the next release.
If you encounter any confusion or frustration during the contribution process, please create a GitHub issue and we'll
do our best to improve the process.
